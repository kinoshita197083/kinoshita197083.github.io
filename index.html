                <p class="article">And it will surely occupy at least a page in future
                    literatures. The debuting of COVID has brought significant impacts to the world, though, some may
                    see it
                    as a marvellous opportunity while some may see it as a catastrophe. The attitude of a sovereign, or
                    even
                    a nation, determine its behavioural decisions as well as its countermeasure towards COVID to a great
                    extent. Speaking of national level of point of view, each nation’s strategies in manging the
                    pandemic
                    largely varied. In essence, it is a dilemma of putting either the economy or social stability as the
                    top
                    priority at that one specific timeframe. “It’s just a flu” has been a famous quote of former
                    president
                    of the U.S. – Donald Trump during the initial stage of the pandemic. This data exploration study
                    attempts to examine such statement, to see whether it was just a soothing statement or in fact, it
                    was a
                    scientific conclusion.</p>

                            have been more than 600 million of confirmed cases of COVID-19, which has been declared as a
                            pandemic on
                            11
                            March 2020 by World Health Organisation (WHO). After more than a decade from the H1N1 Swine
                            Flu
                            (2009),

                            global pandemic, people, and especially, politicians often make comparisons between the two.
                            Although,
                            former is categorised as influenza virus while the latter is corona virus, still, they share
                            many
                            similarities. Not only the contagiousness and respiratory symptoms, but also the evolution

                            the way how human deal with it. Therefore, it will be intriguing to take both into

                            and see

                            of

                            many

                            transmissibility of a disease. This also explains why crude fatality rate of COVID-19 has

                            extremely

                <h2 class="heading">Case Fatality Rate Comparison between 2009 Pandemic & COVID-19</h2>
                <p class="inner-article width-70">Fatality can be simply referred to the death rate per 100
                    cases of an
                    infectious disease. When
                    performing statistical analysis of fatality, there have been three mainstream approaches including
                    Case
                    Fatality Rate (CFR), Infectious Fatality Rate (IFR) and Crude Mortality Rate. CFR has been a popular
                    approach and often cited by media when risk of death of COVID-19 is discussed; It is calculated
                    through
                    “number of death / total of diagnosed cases * 100“ while IFR is calculated as “number of death /
                    total
                    number of infected * 100”. Ideally, IFR seems to be the best approach to answer the question of “how
                    deadly
                    the disease is ?”, however, total number of infected is often not known especially for COVID-19 as
                    there
                    are
                    many people who were symptomless and thus had not been diagnosed as a case. Therefore, CFR becomes a
                    reasonable choice for media as well as the current study in comparing the fatality rate of the
                    diseases.

                    death rate and have been used inconsistently by media, politicians, and researchers. The concepts of
                    Case
                    Fatality Rate (CFR), Infection Fatality Rate (IFR), and Crude Mortality Rate were then introduced
                    and
                    declared CFR will be employed as the base comparing approach between diseases along with the reasons
                    of
                    why
                    such approach. As the result, research question 1 was answered through comparing the CFR between
                    H1N1
                    swine
                    flu (2009) and COVID-19, which supports Trump’s statement and verified that CFR was the approach of
                    his
                    conclusions. In the exploration of the CFR, the seasonal flu, as the extensions of H1N1 flu, was
                    found
                    highly resembling COVID-19 and thus, the health-care system burden of seasonal flu was examined. An
                    interesting pattern was later found and happened to match with the current state of COVID-19. Based
                    on
                    such
                    finding, a hypothesis was proposed inferring that COVID-19 will be very likely to have a significant
                    bounce
                    back in the upcoming quarter or year.</p>

                    graduated. The understanding of different statistical approaches allow clarifications of the puzzle
                    of
                    fatality, which often large varied across nations but we tend to ascribe the reason to economical
                    factors.
                    Media often cited the CFR approach while institutional researches usually employed IFR as they are
                    capable
                    to develop statistical modelling via machine learning and thus, able to estimate the total number of
                    infected with a relatively reasonable amount of errors.
                    As for this study, it is worth noting that the theoretical thoughts were proposed solely based on
                    the
                    healthcare-system burden datasets adapted from U.S. CDC (2020). CFR was employed in exploration due
                    to
                    the
                    absence of data modelling capability. The research approach was to “analyse what I see not what I
                    think”,
                    therefore, the inference may seem to be reasonable to certain degree, but it was not rigorous and
                    thorough.
                    It required large amount of further researches to refine and add complexities such as territory, age
                    and
                    chronic illness. One of the major limitations is that the datasets were limited to the U.S.
                    providing
                    limited representativeness. Data of H1N1 swine flu in 2009, in particular, was almost not possible
                    to be
                    recovered without adapting existing estimations unlike data of COVID-19. When comparing the two
                    disease,
                    age
                    was actually another intriguing factor, which would be even
                    more interesting if it was included into the data explorations.</p>
